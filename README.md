# Ruberts_dungeon_designer
This is my own coding project for a dungeon designing program. It is basically a clone of  Dungeonmapdoodler (https://dungeonmapdoodler.com/), 
but because of the infrequent updates, I decided to try my hand at making my own.

# Who is Rubert/Why is it Rubert's dungeon designer?
Rubert was a wizard in my D&D campaign who designed a dungeon (that funnily enough, I made with Dungeonmapdoodler). I myself am not Rubert if you're wonering.

# Why is your code such an awful mess?
Simple: I am a computer science student, and this is almost more just practice for me so that I can get better at coding.

It's also in very early stages at the moment, so that could also be a reason.
